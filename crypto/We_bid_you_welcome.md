This is the first challenge in the crypto section which was really easy, using an an online tool [dcode](https://www.dcode.fr/cipher-identifier) to analyze the cipher text we see that it's [base64](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=2ahUKEwjR_saO4Mj6AhXThP0HHczqAhwQFnoECAcQAQ&url=https%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FBase64&usg=AOvVaw1QZr6n6e41rkPczxpoNpjT) encoding.




Decrypting with the tool we get **abcctf{w3lcome_t0_abcctf}**
